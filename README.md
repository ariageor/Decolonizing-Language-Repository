# Zoo Interpretation Glossary

A collaborative glossary of terms to reconsider in zoo and conservation education, with suggested alternatives, context, and sources.

## Purpose
A space to connect with others in zoo education and conservation, to unlearn and relearn together, and to rethink zoo interpretation by:
- recognising colonial legacies
- acknowledging bias in knowledge production
- reflecting on how language shapes interpretation
